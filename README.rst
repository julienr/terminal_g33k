TG
==
This is an old project (around 2005) that implement a 3D engine.
I don't work on this project anymore, and it's far from being feature-complete. Therefore
I share it mostly because some code in the sources might be helpful.

The main features are :
- Quake 3 maps loading
- Doom 3 models loading
- Basic physics
- Basic lighting

Unfortunately, I cannot distribute the data.

This is how it looks like
